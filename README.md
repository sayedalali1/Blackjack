Blackjack is a cards game where a player tries to beat the *Dealer* also known as the *House* by having a hand value closer to 21 and not going above that value.

## 1. Blackjack user Story

* As a player when the game begins I would like to see the cards im dealt, based on my cards combined value I can make a decision if i should ask for another card or hold.

* As a player i should be able to see the value of one card out of the two cards the "*House*" holds. 

* As a player i expect the *House* to be logical and able to figure out the value of the cards in play and declares if it is a tie,win or lose.

* As a player i should be able to request another card and/or hold current card, start new game and quit game.
